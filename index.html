    <p id= "paragraph1">First, we would start by teaching everyone how to recycle and why it is important. Then we will let everyone know where recycling bins and other bins are throughout the building.</p> 
    <img id="principal" src="principal.jpg">  
    <p id="paragraph2">After teaching students about the importance of recycling, we would go talk with administrators and people in charge about buying more bins and placing them throughout locations in the school. </p>

    <p id="paragraph3">After getting the approval of administrators and others in charge, we would begin funding for the bins, through donations and possible funds from the alumni foundation.</p>
